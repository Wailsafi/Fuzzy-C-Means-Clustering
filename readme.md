# Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the **Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)** clustering algorithm, a soft clustering technique that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. The algorithm is widely used in pattern recognition, image segmentation, and machine learning applications.

## Features
- Supports multi-dimensional data clustering
- Customizable number of clusters and fuzziness parameter
- Iterative optimization using objective function minimization
- Visualizations for cluster assignments and membership degrees
- Implementation in Python with Jupyter Notebook support

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuzzy-c-means.git
   cd fuzzy-c-means
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and execute `main.ipynb` to perform clustering on a dataset.

## Parameters
The algorithm allows tuning of the following parameters:
- `c`: Number of clusters
- `m`: Fuzziness parameter (default is 2)
- `epsilon`: Convergence threshold
- `max_iter`: Maximum number of iterations
